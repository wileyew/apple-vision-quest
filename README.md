## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/a26566d1-f131-4221-bd5e-69ef22eb5248) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Set up environment variables (required for AI features)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key

# Step 5: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

## OpenAI API Setup

To enable AI-powered features, you'll need an OpenAI API key:

1. **Get API Key**: Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) and create an API key
2. **Configure Environment**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your key:
   ```
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```
3. **Security Note**: Never commit your actual API key to version control

### API Usage

The application uses OpenAI for:
- **GPT-4**: Advanced market analysis and gap identification
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: Real-time search suggestions
- **Fallback Mode**: If API fails, the app falls back to enhanced keyword matching

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.
